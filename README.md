# **MedGraph: AI-Powered Healthcare Insights Navigator**

## **Overview**
MedGraph is an intelligent healthcare analytics system leveraging **GraphRAG**, **ArangoDB**, and **GPU-accelerated graph processing** to uncover deep insights from **synthetic patient data (Synthea)**. Designed for **healthcare providers, researchers, and administrators**, it facilitates:

‚úÖ **Patient Pathway Analysis** ‚Äì Understand patient journeys through diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.  
‚úÖ **Treatment Effectiveness Comparison** ‚Äì Identify which treatments work best for similar patient cohorts.  
‚úÖ **Healthcare Resource Optimization** ‚Äì Detect inefficiencies in hospital operations.  
‚úÖ **Medical Anomaly & Risk Detection** ‚Äì Identify rare disease patterns, misdiagnoses, or adverse reactions.  
‚úÖ **Personalized Care Recommendations** ‚Äì Suggest data-driven care plans based on patient histories.

## **How It Works (Data Flow)**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Loading** ‚Äì The synthetic healthcare dataset from **Synthea** is parsed and loaded into **ArangoDB**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Graph Model Creation** ‚Äì Patient data is transformed into an interconnected **graph structure**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Hybrid Query Execution** ‚Äì  
   - **Simple Queries ‚Üí AQL (ArangoDB Query Language)**  
   - **Complex Queries ‚Üí GPU-accelerated Graph Algorithms (cuGraph/NetworkX)**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Insights Generation** ‚Äì MedGraph analyzes relationships and patterns in patient data.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **User Interface** ‚Äì Results are visualized in **Gradio-powered dashboards**.

## **üõ† Implementation Breakdown**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion**
**Synthea** generates patient data in JSON format, including:  
- **Patients, Encounters, Conditions, Medications, Procedures, Immunizations.**  

#### **Loading Data into ArangoDB (Jupyter Notebook Cell)**
```python
from arango import ArangoClient

# Connect to ArangoDB
client = ArangoClient(hosts="http://localhost:8529")
db = client.db("medgraph_db", username="root", password="password")

# Load Patients Collection
def load_collection(collection_name, data):
    if not db.has_collection(collection_name):
        db.create_collection(collection_name)
    collection = db.collection(collection_name)
    collection.insert_many(data)

# Execute in Jupyter Notebook
load_collection("patients", patient_data)
```
‚úÖ **Data is now structured in ArangoDB with vertex and edge relationships.**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Construction**
The system builds an interconnected **graph model** linking medical entities:

#### **Creating Graph in ArangoDB (Jupyter Notebook Cell)**
```python
graph_name = "healthcare_graph"

edge_definitions = [
    {'edge_collection': 'patients_to_conditions', 'from_vertex_collections': ['patients'], 'to_vertex_collections': ['conditions']},
    {'edge_collection': 'patients_to_medications', 'from_vertex_collections': ['patients'], 'to_vertex_collections': ['medications']},
]

# Create Graph
if db.has_graph(graph_name):
    db.delete_graph(graph_name)
db.create_graph(graph_name, edge_definitions)
```
‚úÖ **Now, patient records are interconnected for graph traversal and analytics.**

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Query Execution & AI Analysis**
MedGraph supports **two types of queries**:

#### **üîπ AQL for Simple Queries (Jupyter Notebook Cell)**
Example: Find all patients with diabetes.
```python
aql_query = """
FOR patient IN patients
    FILTER patient.condition == 'Diabetes'
    RETURN patient
"""
cursor = db.aql.execute(aql_query)
for record in cursor:
    print(record)
```

#### **üîπ Graph Algorithms for Complex Queries (Jupyter Notebook Cell)**
Example: Identifying high-risk patients using **PageRank** in **NetworkX**.
```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.Graph()
for condition in conditions:
    G.add_node(condition["patient_id"], risk_factor=condition["risk_score"])

# Compute risk-based PageRank
pagerank_scores = nx.pagerank(G, alpha=0.85)
pagerank_scores
```
‚úÖ **Allows deeper insights into patient risk patterns.**

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization & User Interface**
To make insights accessible, MedGraph integrates **Gradio** for visual dashboards.

#### **Example: Interactive Patient Insights Dashboard (Jupyter Notebook Cell)**
```python
import gradio as gr

def search_patient(patient_id):
    result = db.collection("patients").get(patient_id)
    return result if result else "Patient Not Found"

# Launch in Jupyter Notebook
gr.Interface(fn=search_patient, inputs="text", outputs="json").launch()
```
‚úÖ **Provides an interactive UI for easy query execution.**

---

## **üìå Setup Instructions**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install arango gradio networkx langchain jupyter
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Run MedGraph in Jupyter Notebook**
- Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
- Load the notebook containing MedGraph code.
- Execute the cells sequentially to process data, build the graph, and interact with insights.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Access Web UI in Jupyter Notebook**
- After running the Gradio cell, access the UI at **`http://localhost:7860`**
